# lib-ft
This is my first 42 cursus project. I'm going to remake some built-in c functions so I can reuse them in my cursus.
#### "Read the subject.pdf for more information"
## Usage
To compile the mandatory part:
```Bash
make
```
To compile all files
```Bash
make bonus
```
Then you can include the header to your code.
```C
#include "<Path>/libft.h"
```
